\maketitle

\begin{frame}{What will you be doing this summer?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What is research like?Ë‡

        \item What can you take away from research? 
        
        \item What skills will you develop?

        \item What community can you expect? 

        \item Econ summer series lunch! 

        \item Prof. Daniel Laurison is hosting workshops for summer research students, click the link \href{https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdeKToK8gTFQD55tRaMmmqATAv2H2DuJwa_c2ph7Kq9sZzQjA/viewform}{here} to register and be in the loop!
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Organization}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Please do NOT just store things in your Downloads folder/Desktop. 
        \item Organize your files in a way that makes it easy for you to find and use. 
        \item Research file organization: Need a way to separate data files (both raw and clean), outputs, and code. 
        \item Life hack: Clean out your downloads and caches every once in a while... Makes your computer run faster.
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Organization pt. 2}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Highly recommend the Gentzkow-Shapiro ``raw, temp, code, output" 4-folder system. 
        \item No need to use this specific one, but find something that you are consistent with and that your PI and other collaborators understand!!
        \item If you're cool, you can use Git for version control. Email me if interested, but this is not necessary!
        \item Ideally, when you have multiple code files, have a ``run" file, or a separate code that will run all of the code in order to produce the final output. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Documentation pt. 1}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Please comment your code! Comment your code for others, including you a few months later. 
        \item Comment to explain your code, comment to organize your code, comment whenever it is useful. 
        \item Whenever you use a new command or learn some new technique, comment it!
        \item COMMENT! COMMENT! COMMENT!
        \item For projects and folders, have a "README", or a file that explains what each file in the folder is, what it is used in, where it came from, and what does it do. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Documention pt. 2}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Have some sort of ``lab notebook" or some way to track what you did every day for each project. 
        \item I like having a (digital) notebook that briefly summarizes what I worked on (which projects, codes, data), what issues I encountered, what questions I have, etc., and then a project specific notebook. 
        \item Ideally, it would be on a platform that allows for sharing with your collaborators and PI. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Working with your economist}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Research is both solitary and collaborative.
    \item Research \textit{assistance} is both independent and \textit{still} assistance
    \item Be proactive in asking questions and asking for direction. 
    \item Feel free to explore yourself, as long as you can explain what you did (and commented it!)
    \item When presenting results, have the code readily available. Ideally, be able to run everything from the raw data (if it doesn't take too long) to demonstrate your results. 
    \item Ask for feedback!
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Working with other RAs}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Talk with your other RAs! Learn from each other, help each other, etc. 
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Coding Tips}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Write all of your code in a code file. Do NOT just put things in a terminal!!
    \item Google is your friend! Statalist is your friend (even if Nick Cox is not)! Code documentation CAN be your friend!
    \item ChatGPT and other LLMs can be your friend, in certain languages. For R and Python, likely yes, but not as much in Stata. 
    \item Only use code that you understand. 
    \item In the repository, I will share some coding resources for Stata, R, using ChatGPT, and LaTeX. 
\end{itemize}
     
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Presenting Results}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item How to present results? 
        \item Can use slides, Beamer (if you have equations/code)
        \item .md and .qmd can present both code and output. Works best for R generally. 
        \item Highly recommend something like Jupyter notebooks for Python
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
