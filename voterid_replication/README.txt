CVAP
CVAP data is from the 5 year ACS s.t. CVAP_2005.csv, for example, has the estimates from the 2005-2009 ACS 5-Year Survey. 
CVAP_2005.csv: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/voting-rights/cvap.2009.html#list-tab-1518558936
Used the estimates from the 2005-2009 ACS 5 year survey for 2004. 
Used the estimates from the 2017-2021 ACS 5 Year survey for 2018 and 2020. 


ACS_1yr_estimates
1 year ACS estimates for demographics
Census controls come from the ACS 1 year estimates, downloaded from social explorer for all years other than 2004 and 2020. For 2020, I used the 1 year estimates from ACS 2019, and I used 2006 for 2004, since 2006 is the closest year.
